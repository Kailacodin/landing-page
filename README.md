I will be editing a webpage using CSS and Flexbox properties, based on images provided  by the Odin Project

**Update post Project**
This was my first time creating a webpage, and it was tricky. I will definately need more practice. 
I could not figure out some of the formatiting structures, so I'll be playing around a little more.
More projects to come!
